For my project, I will design a website on my own private server 
which will provide a list of web links, image snapshots of detailed code of exercises that will teach the basics of C++ since thats the current programing language i know most of as of now. I will design the website itself by sorting the links in an array list which the links and/or examples, basically a book mark. Eacblock in the array list will have a block of data of a youtube link and a breif
paragraph of a few sentences as a description/practice exercises/etc. Will be using youtube links from thenewboston C++ playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvC1WCdV1XU&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83  which has a list of links..



Heres the website link to my webpage: 159.203.247.230:8080
