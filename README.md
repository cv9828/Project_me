# Project_me


	For my project, I will design a website on my own private server 
which will provide a list of web links, image snapshots of detailed code of exercises
that will teach the basics of python
programing. I will design the website itself by sorting the links in an array
list which the links and/or examples, basically a book mark . Each array will 
have at least 3 examples for each topic and/or a video web link.
